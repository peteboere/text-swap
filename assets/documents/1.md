When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. If these lines aren't straight,
your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Everyone wants to
enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.

Just use the old one inch brush. It is a lot of fun. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.
Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Without washing
the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of
Sap Green. A happy cloud.

Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. But they're very easily
killed. Clouds are delicate. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. With something so
strong, a little bit can go a long way. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little
accidents. Trees grow however makes them happy.

Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. It all happens
automatically. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Sometimes you learn more from
your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.

Let your imagination be your guide. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create
all these happy things? If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.

Let's get wild today. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. That
easy.

This is your world. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. That is when you can
experience true joy, when you have no fear.
